eCommerce Store (Work in Progress)
This is a work-in-progress eCommerce store built using Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. The goal of this project is to create a fully functional online store where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and proceed with checkout.

Current Features:
User registration and authentication

Product catalog with basic filtering

Shopping cart functionality (add/remove items)

Basic order processing

Technologies Used:
Spring Boot for backend development

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end design and interactivity

SQL for database management (product inventory, user data, orders, etc.)

Future Features (Planned):

Payment gateway integration

Order history and tracking

This project is ongoing, and I continue to add new features as I learn and grow as a developer. Feel free to explore the current implementation and stay tuned for updates!
